#summary Welcome to RLog project page.

RLog has been a stand-alone logging library for C++ since 2002.  It was originally a set of logging classes embedded in [http://arg0.net/encfs EncFS] (an encrypted filesystem based on [http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ FUSE]), but was broken off into a separate library so it could be reused.

The main source code repository is maintained using the revision control system [http://darcs.net/ Darcs].  The Subversion repository on Google is a snapshot.  You can also browse check-ins to the [http://arg0.net/cgi-bin/darcsweb.cgi?r=rlog;a=summary main repository].
